LONG DESCRIPTION
    From wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_roulette):
    
    Russian roulette (Russian: Русская рулетка) is a lethal game of chance in which
    a player places a single round in a revolver, 
    spins the cylinder, 
    places the muzzle against their head, 
    and pulls the trigger. 
    
    "Russian" refers to the supposed country of origin, and
    roulette to the element of risk-taking and the spinning 
    of the revolver's cylinder, which is reminiscent of 
    a spinning roulette wheel.
